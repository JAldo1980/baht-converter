<h1>What I Built</h1>
I built this cool little code snippet that converts Thai Baht to Pounds Sterling and vice versa! ðŸ’°ðŸ’·

<h2>Aim/Objective</h2>
The main purpose was to build a small project focused on the .map() method. Practice, practice, practice!

Itâ€™s simple really, a radio button is selected to identify the currency type to convert, I then made it so that it takes the user input for the currency amount to convert, and outputs the converted currency value.

The focus was on the code using the .map() method to change the different currency rates.

When the "CONVERT" button is clicked, the code checks whether the user has selected Thai Baht or Pound Sterling pushes the entered currency value to an array and then uses the .map() method to calculate the converted currency value. The result is then rendered to the DOM.

Finally, I wanted a resetValues function to clear the input fields and uncheck the radio buttons after the conversion is complete.
